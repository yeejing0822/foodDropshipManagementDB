INTRODUCTION
This case study is about ABC SDN BHD (ABC) which is a stockist that has been employed by SHARIFAH FOOD SDN BHD to manage and recruit sales agents and dropships. The number of agents and dropships have increased along with the growth of the business. As a result, ABC found difficulty in managing all the stockist processes. Thus, ABC requires a system built to keep track of the product inventory, purchases, orders as well as commission payment for agent and dropship. We have analysed the situation in this case and discovered user requirements for the system. Then, we categorize the user requirements according to the entity needed in the system. We have also made several assumptions so that the system can work flawlessly.
